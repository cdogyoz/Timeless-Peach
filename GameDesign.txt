Gameplay Summary
----------------
//ALL IDEAS ARE WIP 

The player begins the game by creating their character. 
The character creation fields are as follows:
	-Character Name
	-Character Race (Human, Giant, etc.. whatever we decide to include)
	-Stats

The goal of the game is to descend 20 levels into the Dungeon of the Timeless, retrieve the Aether Orb, then ascend back up and out the exit to win the game.

Dungeon Levels (Tentative - Feel free to add ideas)
--------------
The Crypt - Level filled with undead enemies. They come from the graves to attack you. Sequential large rooms filled with graves connected by long narrow hallways.
